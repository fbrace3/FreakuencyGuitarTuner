# The README file should explain what your app does, how to run it, and any other necessary instructions. 
# Your discussion post is the main place you will be discussing the project, but the README needs to include enough information so that we understand how to use the app, and what 3rd party sources you used when creating it

Welcome to Freakuency - a music app with a built-in (incomplete) tuner, synth piano, metronome, and more.

1. To run the app, open it and register for an account. (you can also log in with the test account: username: admin, password: admin)

2. Once you have an account, you can log in and use the (incomplete) tuners, metronome, and synth or browse through our "catalog" of tablature.
3.  *the Resources and shopping tab are incomplete!

Resources:
Our class activities.  We used a few of our class activities as templates for our app
The book
The main resource we used was ChatGPT.  It proved very useful in debugging errors and explaing code.  It helped with layouts as well but could not be trusted entirely.
